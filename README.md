# Windows Server 2012 R2 â€“ Active Directory & Role Management Lab

This repository documents a hands-on lab. The lab involved configuring a Windows Server 2012 R2 environment in a virtual machine, performing system administration tasks such as user and group management, directory structuring, permission setting, and installing server roles.

## Lab Objectives

- Deploy and configure a Windows Server VM
- Build a directory tree structure using command-line tools
- Create and manage local users and groups
- Configure shared folder permissions based on group access
- Install and verify server roles (Web Server/IIS)

## Key Tasks

- **Deployed** a Windows Server 2012 R2 VM using VirtualBox with custom hardware specs
- **Renamed** the server to match the lab naming convention and documented the configuration setup
- **Built** a complete file and folder structure for a sample course (`MST100`) via the Command Prompt
- **Created** users and groups (e.g., Programmers, Athletes, Parking) and applied password policies, home directories, and account restrictions
- **Assigned** specific share permissions using group-based access control on the MST100 directory
- **Installed** the Web Server (IIS) role and **launched** the management interface to validate installation
